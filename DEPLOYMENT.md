# Hostinger Deployment - Fixed Version

## 🚀 **Updated Files Ready for Upload**

Your website is now configured to work properly with Hostinger static hosting. Here's what changed:

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **✅ Switched to HashRouter** - URLs now use `#` (e.g., `yoursite.com/#/contact`)
2. **✅ Added .htaccess file** - For Apache server configuration
3. **✅ Added redirect HTML files** - Fallback for direct URL access
4. **✅ Updated Vite configuration** - Optimized for static hosting

### **Files to Upload to Hostinger:**

Upload ALL files from the `dist/` folder to your `public_html/` directory:

```
dist/
├── .htaccess                    # Apache configuration
├── index.html                   # Main application
├── contact.html                 # Redirect to /#/contact
├── services.html                # Redirect to /#/services
├── apps.html                    # Redirect to /#/apps
├── assets/
│   ├── index-CspihT1K.js       # JavaScript bundle
│   └── index-DCOeCLF9.css      # CSS bundle
├── favicon.ico
├── robots.txt
├── sitemap.xml
├── ta-logo.png
├── ta-logo.webp
├── ta-text.png
├── ta-text.webp
├── ta.jpeg
├── hero-video-placeholder.mp4
└── vite.svg
```

## 🔧 **How It Works Now:**

### **URL Structure:**

-   **Home**: `yoursite.com/` or `yoursite.com/#/`
-   **Services**: `yoursite.com/#/services`
-   **Apps**: `yoursite.com/#/apps`
-   **Contact**: `yoursite.com/#/contact`

### **Fallback System:**

-   If someone visits `yoursite.com/contact` directly, they'll be redirected to `yoursite.com/#/contact`
-   The .htaccess file handles most routing issues
-   HashRouter ensures the React app works properly

## 📋 **Deployment Steps:**

1. **Upload all files** from `dist/` to Hostinger's `public_html/`
2. **Test the main page**: `yoursite.com/`
3. **Test navigation**: Click through the menu items
4. **Test direct URLs**: Try `yoursite.com/contact` (should redirect)
5. **Test the contact form**: Make sure it submits properly

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

-   ✅ **Main page loads** without errors
-   ✅ **Navigation works** (uses hash routing)
-   ✅ **Direct URLs redirect** to hash versions
-   ✅ **Contact form submits** to Google Sheets
-   ✅ **reCAPTCHA works** properly
-   ✅ **All assets load** correctly

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If the main page doesn't load:**

-   Check that `index.html` is in the root of `public_html/`
-   Verify file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)

### **If navigation doesn't work:**

-   Check browser console for JavaScript errors
-   Ensure all files in `assets/` folder are uploaded

### **If contact form doesn't work:**

-   Verify your reCAPTCHA site key is correct
-   Check that your Google Apps Script URL is correct
-   Test the Google Apps Script URL directly

## 🎉 **You're All Set!**

Your website should now work perfectly on Hostinger with:

-   ✅ Proper routing
-   ✅ Contact form functionality
-   ✅ reCAPTCHA protection
-   ✅ Google Sheets integration
-   ✅ Professional design and animations

**Upload the files and test it out!** 🚀
